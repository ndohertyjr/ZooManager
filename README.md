# ZooManager

*Project Summary:

This project allows a user to import a .txt file into a local vector for the purpose of adding and deleting animals in a zoo's system.  The program maintains the .txt file with persistant data.

*Highlights:

This project demonstrates the ability to incorporate multiple languages into one program, specifically Java and C++.  Additionally, the use of a local vector and multiple classes, makes the code easy to ready and modular.

*Improvements:

The program could be improved my allowing a user to sort and print the animals based on a specific attribute.  An improved sorting method would allow the user to obtain more specific results rather than having to print every animal at once.

*Difficulties:

I did not struggle with any aspect of this code, the part that took the longest was simply writing out the lines.  

*Transferrable Skills:

The ability to incorporate multiple languages may be the most valuable piece of information I learned with this project.  By doing so, I can make a project more versatile and efficient based on the project's goal.

*How is the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable:

By utilizing multiple classes, the code is entirely modular.  Updates can be made to each method individually without impacting the main method.  The code is notated effectively, with notes that clearly describe a method's purpose.
